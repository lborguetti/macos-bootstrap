Keeping in mind the KISS principle this few lines of code can be used
to create/setup an entire workspace without complexity. 

This is a idempotent script used to provision my entire developer environment.

Idempotent scripts can be called multiple times and each time itâ€™s called, it will
have the same effects on the system.

To understand how to use this script I recommend you to read the code, after all, 
it's not good practice to run a script that you don't know.

Currently tested only in macOS Ventura 13+.

Note/Tip: before to start use this script you need to install [Homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation).
